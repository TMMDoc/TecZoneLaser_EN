<p>For a given material, there are usually multiple LTTs that can
be used. TecZone Laser can sort the LTTs and select a good default LTT based on various criteria.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the background, TecZone Laser counts how many times each LTT was
manually selected by user. The LTTs will be listed with the most frequently used ones at the top, and further highlighted by a star (<span class="image"><img src="img/star.png" alt="star" width="8"></span>), whose size is based on the frequency of usage. The bigger the star, the more frequent is its usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LTT are also sorted based on length unit (metric vs
imperial). Further, LTTs are then sorted based on gas type with N2
being listed before O2 before Air before Argon.
Finally, they are sorted based on whether the LTT is a
Trumpf standard table or a Trumpf additional table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is yet another way in which TecZone Laser tries to make selecting
the right LTT easier. In the machine configuration dialog, user can
unselect the focal lengths (aka lense/cutting head) that are not
available on their side. All LTTs that are for these focal lengths will
not be visible to the user.</p>
