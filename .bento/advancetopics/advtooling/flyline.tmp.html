<p>FlyLine is fast cutting, where the laser beam is switched on and off without stopping the axes. Repetitive contours in hole patterns are additionally prepared for optimized processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FlyLine is used for high-speed processing with reduced quality
expectations.
In order to work with FlyLine just select a FlyLine table from
the menu.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the grids are regular for TecZone Laser to
identify them and tool them up with FlyLine. They could be partial or
staggered.</p>

<p>The software can handle even staggered grids. When cutting the
circles, the software will cut all the circles in the same direction,
clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the setting that controls the
cutting direction for inner contours in the LTT.</p>

<p>All transitions when cutting an ob-round grid are smooth.
Where necessary, the software will introduce two curves (5 mm dia) to
ensure that the head moves out from a cut tangentially and also moves
into the next cut tangentially.</p>
