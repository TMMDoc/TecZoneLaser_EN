<p>Finishing rules define all processes done automatically
after nesting.
They have many utilities, including preventing collisions, restoring
balance to tilting parts, and making optimal use of the entire surface of
a worksheet. The user can add, remove or modify
rules. The
order of rules in this list is important; while auto tooling. When TecZone Laser
Cut finishes generating tooling for a contour, it checks this contour
against each rule in this list, starting at the first rule. If the shape
matches any rule, the corresponding action is applied; the software does
not process any further rules for this contour. The checkbox at the
beginning of each row can be used to temporarily disable any rule
without having to delete it.</p>

<p>TecZone Laser recognizes by doing precise calculations that some
parts could tilt on the layout sheet. This is why setting up the sheet
details like loading tolerance are extremely important. TecZone Laser
Cut will mark with red color the contours
considered unstable, so you&#8217;ll be able to adjust the finishing rules in
order to avoid possible accidents while laser cutting.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we have to set this through three finishing
rules that keeps in focus the outer contour.
First of all, we have to define a piece size limit of 9999 millimeters (a
limit rarely reached in our examples). The second rule has to cover the
parts with a maximum length of 100 mm. We do so by setting the parameter
"Size" as 100x100. Therefore, remains to select the parts smaller than 50
millimetres and that means exactly "50 x 50" for the size parameter.
Always remember that "n" millimeters must be given in a
"width x height" format. The image below
shows how the finishing rules table should look like.</p>
