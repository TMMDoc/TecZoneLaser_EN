<p><strong>TwinLine</strong> is a method wherein the tool width is equal to the distance between the contour lines of two adjacent sections on the sheet during nesting. Thus, just one cut is used in the processing of these two contours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TwinLine leads to significant savings in terms of machine time
and material usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure the stability of the
twinlined parts on the slat pins and the ability to automatically add
microjoints to twinline groups, TecZone Laser comes with multiple options to create optimal
twinline groups.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the software to support both the safety and
easy strategy of twinline tooling. But TecZone Laser goes a step further and can
analyze and automatically choose the right strategy for any given
twinline group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three strategies:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>TIO (TwinLine-Island-Outer)
strategy</strong>: In this strategy, the software will create three
different kinds of tooling paths from a twinline block.<br></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>TwinLine: These are the twinline
paths between overlapping edges of the adjacent parts. These are always
open paths. Once the software detects these paths, they are cut first,
before any other path.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Island: These are sheet skeleton
islands formed between parts of the block. These islands are cut next.
Islands are always closed contours. Cutting an island always begins at a
node that is already touched by a twinline path.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outer: There will always be one
outer contour for a twinline block. This is always cut at the end. The
software will approach this outer contour from the left-bottom or
left-top, depending on the prescribed cutting direction (clockwise or
anticlockwise) for outer contours in settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Partwise-safe strategy</strong>: This strategy is
similar (probably not identical) to the safety strategy of
Trutops/Boost. In this strategy, cutting progresses to the next part only
after the current part is cut completely free. At junction nodes where
adjacent parts touch, preparatory cuts are made. The purpose of these
preparatory cuts is to avoid the laser head coming close to a part that is
already cut (and possibly tilting).</p>

</ol>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The software, when on islands, instead of just doing a precut, completely cuts the island free (as shown in the below image). If this is not done, when processing the last part, it is possible
that the entire block is cut free before some inner islands are cut
free.</p>

<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Partwise strategy</strong>: This strategy is similar
to the partwise-safe strategy, but there are no preparatory cuts. At
junction nodes, cutting for the next part will resume 1.25 mm distance
into the twinline path. That is, cutting will resume a little distance
away from the junction node, again cutting a small portion of the cut
path. This seems impossible for situations where parts could tilt, hence, it is recommended only for thick sheets where parts will not tilt. The user
can choose the preferred strategy from the laser settings as shown in the
screenshot below. The tooltip on the strategy explains the strategy and
its applicability.</p>

<h3 id="_nanojoints_vs_microjoints_in_a_twinline_situation">Nanojoints vs Microjoints in a TwinLine Situation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On twinlined edges, only nanojoints (or piercing on contour)
are possible. On the edges of an island or outer boundary, all types of
joints (hard, soft, or nano) are possible. When applying the
<em>One Piece strategy</em>, TecZone Laser will try to minimize
the number of joints on the twinlined edge with the assumption that
hard/soft joints (with an approach path) are preferred over nanojoints
(where piercing is done on the contour). Nanojoints are shown with tiny
yellow dots.</p>
