<p>TecZone Laser supports manual sheet slicing cuts. Just like automatic sheet slicing cuts, TecZone Laser will carefully manage the machine head at the sheet boundaries by locking the head position. The software can also detect if a remainder sheet is created by such a cut and can export the same. However, if an automatic remainder cut is also present, then the remainder sheet created by manual slices is ignored.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manual sheet slicing cuts are supported even for non-rectangular sheets.</p>
