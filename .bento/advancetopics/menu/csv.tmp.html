<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you click on <strong>Release NC</strong> in the Layouts tab, apart from creating NC and reports, the software exports a CSV file listing the parts produced in the job. An ERP software could read this file to update the status of an order in its system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <strong>Application setting</strong> navigate to <strong>CutCAM &#8594; LaserCAM &#8594; Cut outputs</strong> to modify the folder destination where the released-parts CSV will be saved.</p>
</div>
