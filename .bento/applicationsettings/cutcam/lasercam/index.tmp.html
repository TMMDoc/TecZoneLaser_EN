<p><strong>Choose cutting condition by</strong> - This setting is to define how the cutting condition will be selected. The options include Maximum segment length, Average segment length and Area. The area is the conventional setting deciding on the TRUMPF rules, and Max and average segments decide accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Switch to slower cutting condition when approach is constrained</strong> - The laser head switches to a slow speed cutting situation when the sheet geometry for the approach is complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Process for open polylines</strong> - When open polylines are found in a part, depending on which option is selected, Cut will process the polyline accordingly. The options includes Cut, Mark, None and Based on layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Cut/Mark open polylines</strong> - The option is to cut or mark open polylines
backwards. This setting will only apply if cut or mark is set for the process for open
polylines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mark forming footprint</strong> - When a counter sink situation is detected by Cut, it
automatically moves the outer circle to the layer Forming footprint. If this option is
checked, geometry in Form footprint layer will be marked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stitch cutting threshold distance (0 = disable)</strong> - This option is to define the maximum distance between two cuts which will be considered for stitch cut.</p>

<p><strong>Rounding tolerance (distance of corner from rounding tip)</strong> - This option is to define the
maximum distance allowed from the corner to the rounding tip as shown in the image
below. The distance of the corner from the rounding tip is directly proportional to the
rounding radius. Based on the value entered here, Cut will select the rounding radius in
the range of min. and max. If selecting the smallest radius does not bring this distance
within the tolerance value, then rounding will not be applied (looping or cooling might
be applied).</p>

proportional to radius. At a sharp corner, if selecting smallest radius does not bring this
distance within the value entered here, looping will not be applied (rounding or cooling
might still be applied).</p>

adjacent parts. Suitable for thin sheets where parts could tip.</p>

<h2 id="_vaporization">Vaporization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">

<p><strong>Vaporize</strong> - This setting will control if vaporization must be done or not. And, if it must be
done, which portions of the laser cutting path must be vaporized.</p>

vaporized.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Full path</em> - The entire cutting path including the pierce, approach and contour will be
vaporized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Pierce point vaporization circle radius</strong> - If a value greater than zero is entered here, the
software will move the laser head in a small circle around the pierce point with the
vaporizing laser on (circle vaporization). The value decides the radius of this circle. If this
value is zero, vaporizing laser will be turned on exactly on top of the piercing point and
then immediately turned off (point vaporization).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Vaporize marking</strong> - This option is to enable or disable vaporization. Note that laser text
markings which are etched using TC_WRITE macro are never vaporized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When these settings are modified, there will be no visible change in Cut UI except that the
NC-code icon will get re-enabled if it was disabled earlier. This is because these settings have
an impact on code generation. Generated vaporizing code for different cuts is described in
the table below.</p>

If Vaporize = Full path, the entire contour, including pierce and
approach will be vaporized. However, during the vaporizing pass, beam
compensation is turned off. It is not necessary that the cut is
performed immediately after vaporization. If a contour has more than
1 microjoint and hence multiple lasers cut pieces, all the cut pieces of
that contour are vaporized first. Then, the cutting of the contour starts.
This vaporization sequence is called contour-wise, as each contour is
vaporized before it is cut. This usually leads to efficient head
movement.</p>

path are vaporized first and at once following that, the laser head will
reposition over the pierce point and start actual cutting. For this
vaporizing option and for Vaporize = Pierce, the pierce and approach
are always vaporized just before executing the cut. This type of
vaporization sequence is called cut-wise, as each cut piece is vaporized
before it is cut.</p>
