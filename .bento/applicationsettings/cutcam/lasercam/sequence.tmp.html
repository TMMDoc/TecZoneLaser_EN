<h3 id="_laser_processing_sequence">Laser Processing Sequence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use this to define the laser processing sequence, this is
useful if you have any piercing or marking that needs to be processed first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Standard</strong> - No specific order is enforced between marking and cutting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mark Cut</strong> - Does all marking first and then cutting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Pierce Cut</strong> - Splits all laser tooling into piercing operation and then cutting operation.
All pierces are done first followed by cut/mark operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mark Pierce Cut</strong> - Like above but all markings are finished first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Pierce Mark Cut</strong> - Like the third option but between cut &amp; mark, marking is done first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_laser_sequence_2">Laser Sequence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This drop-down gives options to choose the laser sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Partwise</strong> - If this choice is selected, sequencing is done part wise. Once operations on
a part starts, it will proceed to another part only after all operations on that part are
finished. It is not necessary that the sequence within each part is same across all its
instances on the layout. Depending on where the machine head is coming from and
where it needs to go next, the order within a part could vary across instances of the
same part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Partwise Native</strong> - If this option is selected, sequencing is done partwise. Once
operations on a part start, it will proceed to another part only after all operations on
that part are finished. The sequence within a part and all its instances will be same as
the part native tooling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Inner First</strong> - All tooling on inner contours are sequenced first followed by the outer
contours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Sort by contour size</strong> - All tooling on inner contours is processed before outer contours
and will be sorted based on contour size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Do pre-pierce part-by-part</strong> - Pierce operations will be done partwise. Once all the piercing
is done on a part, it will finish the cut before proceeding to the next part.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Move pierce points to reduce travel</strong> - This checkbox is to choose a different approach
point location to reduce traverse distance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Move pierce points to prevent tilting</strong> - This checkbox is to choose a different approach
point location to avoid tipping of the cut-outs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Microjoint nested holes if tilting/falling through</strong> - This checkbox is to microjoint a
contour with parts nested inside of them only if the contour is evaluated as a fall
through or being tilted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Ignore holes smaller than this</strong> - Holes smaller than the given value are considered not big
enough for the height sensor to dive the machine head into it and hence ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minimum cutting head height when traversing</strong> - Minimum head distance from the sheet
when doing head-up traversal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Max. head down traverse distance</strong> - The software automatically calculates a head down
traverse limit based on nozzle distance from sheet. The lower of the calculated value and
the value entered here will be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Route traverse lines around holes</strong> - Turn on to route the laser head around cut-outs, if
possible, instead of lifting head up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Allowance when routing around holes</strong> - When routing lines to avoid cut-outs, this
distance will be maintained from the traverse path to the edge of a cut. If this value is
too high to route traverse lines around the cut-outs, then those traverse lines will be
processed with the machine head being raised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lift nozzle if routing penalty more than</strong> - This option is used to define if the nozzle should
be lifted if the routing penalty is more than this value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Allowance when routing around tilting holes</strong> - This option is to define the routing
allowance around tilting holes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Always reposition with head-up between holes</strong> - This option should be checked if subprograms
should be safe for post-production.</p>
